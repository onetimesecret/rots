"""Standardised exit codes for all OTS CLI tools.

All commands across rots, lots, and pots use this scheme so that CI
pipelines and shell scripts can distinguish between different failure
modes.

Usage::

    from ots_shared.exit_codes import EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE, EXIT_PARTIAL, EXIT_PRECOND

    raise SystemExit(EXIT_PARTIAL)
"""

EXIT_SUCCESS: int = 0
"""Command completed successfully; all operations applied."""

EXIT_FAILURE: int = 1
"""General command failure (unexpected error, bad arguments, etc.)."""

EXIT_PARTIAL: int = 2
"""Partial success: at least one operation succeeded and at least one failed.

Check the command output for details on which operations failed."""

EXIT_PRECOND: int = 3
"""Precondition not met: required configuration is absent.

Examples: missing env file, missing secrets, image not pulled.
No destructive action was attempted."""
