"""Hetzner Cloud network zone constants and location-to-zone mapping.

A Hetzner Network is anchored in exactly one network zone, and each
subnet must belong to that same zone. Servers are deployed in
*locations* (e.g. ``nbg1``, ``fsn1``); the location's zone must match
the network's zone or attaching the server to the network fails.

These constants exist as a single source of truth so the
``network ensure`` reconciler can validate ``.otsinfra.yaml`` without
making an API call.
